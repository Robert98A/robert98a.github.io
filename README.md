# Data Analytics Portfolio — Robert Amartisoaei

## Overview
Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio. I am an Electrical Engineer transitioned into Data Analytics, leveraging a background in telecommunications testing, validation, and performance monitoring to solve business problems.

This repository demonstrates my ability to clean, analyze, and interpret complex datasets using **SQL**, **R**, and **Tableau**. It features selected case studies that translate technical findings into actionable strategic insights, following a structured workflow from raw data processing to visualization and recommendation.

## Repository Structure

The project directory is organized to ensure reproducibility and clarity:

* `data/`: Contains raw, processed, and cleaned datasets.
* `scripts/`: Modular SQL and R scripts for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
* `outputs/`: Generated figures and summary tables.
* `reports/`: Final deliverables in R Markdown, HTML, and PDF formats.

## Getting Started

To replicate the analysis or explore the code locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/robert98a/robert98a.github.io.git](https://github.com/robert98a/robert98a.github.io.git)
    ```
2.  **Environment Setup:**
    * Ensure R and RStudio are installed.
    * Install required R packages: `install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "lubridate", "janitor"))`.
3.  **Run Analysis:**
    * Navigate to the `scripts/` folder of the specific case study.
    * Open the `.R` or `.Rmd` file in RStudio and execute to generate outputs.
