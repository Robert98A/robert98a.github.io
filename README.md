# Data Analytics Portfolio — Robert Amartisoaei

Welcome to my professional Data Analytics Portfolio.  
This repository showcases selected case studies and analytical projects that demonstrate my ability to clean, analyze, and interpret data and translate findings into actionable business insights.

Each project follows a structured analytics workflow — Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act — and includes reproducible scripts, clear visualizations, and business-focused recommendations.

## About Me

I am an Electrical Engineer transitioned into Data Analytics, with hands-on experience in telecommunications testing, validation, and performance monitoring.

My background enables me to:
- Work confidently with complex technical systems and large datasets  
- Apply a structured, methodical approach to problem-solving  
- Translate technical findings into insights understandable by non-technical stakeholders  

I am seeking opportunities where data-driven insights support strategic and operational decision-making.
