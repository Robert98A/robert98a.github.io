# [Cyclistic bike-share case study]

## 1. Business Task
Cyclistic’s goal is to increase annual memberships and convert casual riders to members, because annual members generate more long-term revenue. To help them do this, I’ll go by understanding how casual riders and members use Cyclistic’s bike-share system differently, analyzing data over a few years. My insights will help marketing team design strategies to encourage casual riders to convert to annual members.

## 5. Key Findings
• Casual riders take significantly longer rides on average than annual members.
• Casual riders take more rides on weekends, while members ride mostly on weekdays.
• Casual riders have more rides afternoon and evening, while member riders have significantly more rides
in the morning and evening.
• Casual riders take more rides in summer, while member riders are more consistently throughout the
year.

## 6. Recommendations
• Launch a targeted summer marketing campaign offering discounted or trial annual memberships(1-3
months) when casual ridership is at its peak. This increases the chances of converting casual riders
during the period when they use the system most.
• Give promotional discounts, minievents or weekly/monthly gifts for short memberships (weekly, monthly),
to engage casual riders when their activity peaks.
• Introduce long-ride membership benefits within the Cyclistic app, such as reward points, extended
ride-time allowances, or discounted pricing for longer trips. That will motivate casual riders who already
prefer extended rides to convert to annual memberships.
