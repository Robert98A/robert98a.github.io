# Cyclistic bike-share analysis  
Google data analytics capstone project

## 1. Business task

Determine how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. The purpose is to support the marketing team in designing strategies that encourage casual riders to convert into annual members.

## 2. Data source

The analysis uses 12 months of public trip data from the Cyclistic (Divvy) bike-share system.  
Each file contains ride IDs, timestamps, station names, bike types, and rider types.  
Personal identifiers have been removed to protect privacy.  
The data is appropriate because it directly records how each user type interacts with the system.

## 3. Data cleaning and preparation

Tools used: SQL and R.

Main steps:
- Imported 12 CSV files and standardized column names.
- Converted start and end times to proper datetime formats.
- Calculated ride length as the difference between end and start time.
- Extracted the day of the week from the start timestamp.
- Removed rides with negative or unrealistic durations.
- Removed records with missing timestamps or rider types.
- Merged all monthly files into a single dataset.
- Verified consistency in column types across all data.

The cleaned dataset was then used for exploration and analysis.

## 4. Analysis

### Descriptive Findings
- Casual riders consistently take longer rides than annual members.
- Casual rider activity peaks on weekends.
- Annual members use the system more often on weekdays, especially during commuting hours.
- Casual rider usage increases significantly in warmer months.
- Annual members show more consistent usage across the whole year.

### Observed patterns
- Members appear to use the system primarily for transportation and commuting.
- Casual riders appear to use the system mainly for leisure and tourism.
- Ride length is a strong differentiator between the two groups.
- Weekday vs. weekend behavior is distinct and consistent across months.

## 5. Key findings

1. Casual riders take longer rides than members, indicating more leisure-focused usage.  
2. Members ride more often during weekdays, matching commuting patterns.  
3. Casual riders show peak activity on weekends and in summer months.  
4. Annual members complete more total rides despite shorter durations.  
5. Seasonal trends strongly influence casual rider behavior.

## 6. Recommendations

1. Promote annual memberships during the summer, when casual usage is highest.  
2. Emphasize the benefits of membership for commuters, such as cost savings and reliability.  
3. Offer introductory membership discounts or short-term trials aimed at high-frequency casual riders to build long-term habits.

These recommendations directly follow from the observed behavioral differences between rider types.

## 7. Tools used

SQL for aggregation and filtering.  
R and spreadsheets for data cleaning, transformation, and summary statistics.  
Tableau or R visualizations for charts and comparisons.
