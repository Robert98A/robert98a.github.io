## Executive Summary

I am an Electrical Engineer transitioning into Data Analytics, combining a rigorous technical background in telecommunications and signal processing with modern data science methodologies. My engineering experience has instilled a disciplined, structural approach to complex systems, which I leverage to transform raw data into reliable, actionable business insights.

I have recently expanded my technical toolkit through the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**, strengthening my proficiency in SQL, R, and Tableau to solve real-world business problems. I aim to bridge the gap between technical data complexity and strategic decision-making through clear analysis and documentation.

## Featured Case Studies

### 1. Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis
**Project Type:** Google Data Analytics Capstone

**The Challenge**
Analyze historical user data to identify behavioral differences between "casual" riders and annual members. The objective was to design a data-driven marketing strategy to convert casual users into long-term subscribers.

**Methodology & Tools**
* **SQL:** Merged and standardized 12 months of trip data, handling millions of records.
* **R:** Performed data cleaning and feature engineering (created variables for ride duration and day-of-week analysis).
* **Tableau:** Developed visualizations to highlight usage trends.

**Key Findings**
* **Usage Patterns:** Casual riders predominately use the service on weekends for leisure, whereas annual members use the service consistently on weekdays for commuting.
* **Recommendation:** Proposed a targeted digital marketing campaign focusing on weekend leisure riders, highlighting the cost-benefits of annual membership for frequent weekend use.
