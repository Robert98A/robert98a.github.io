## Summary

I am a Data Analyst with a strong technical foundation in Electrical Engineering and professional experience as a System Test Technician. I combine the rigorous, methodical approach required for hardware validation and network monitoring with modern data science methodologies.

My background involves hands-on experience in testing and validating telecommunications equipment, where precision and attention to detail are critical. I have recently expanded my skillset through the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**, mastering SQL, R, and Tableau to transform complex datasets into clear, reliable business insights. I aim to apply this technical discipline to support data-driven decision-making.

## Featured Case Studies

### 1. Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis
**Project Type:** Google Data Analytics Capstone

**The Challenge**
Analyze historical user data to identify behavioral differences between "casual" riders and annual members. The objective was to design a data-driven marketing strategy to convert casual users into long-term subscribers.

**Methodology & Tools**
* **SQL:** Merged and standardized 12 months of trip data, handling millions of records.
* **R:** Performed data cleaning and feature engineering (created variables for ride duration and day-of-week analysis).
* **Tableau:** Developed visualizations to highlight usage trends.

**Key Findings**
* **Usage Patterns:** Casual riders predominately use the service on weekends for leisure, whereas annual members use the service consistently on weekdays for commuting.
* **Recommendation:** Proposed a targeted digital marketing campaign focusing on weekend leisure riders, highlighting the cost-benefits of annual membership for frequent weekend use.
