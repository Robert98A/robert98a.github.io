## Professional Overview

I am a **Data Analyst with an engineering background**, combining a strong foundation in **electrical engineering and telecommunications testing** with modern data analytics skills.

My professional experience includes **system testing, validation, and network performance monitoring**, where accuracy, consistency, and structured problem-solving are essential. I have transitioned these skills into data analytics, focusing on **cleaning, analyzing, and interpreting data to support business decisions**.

I completed the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**, gaining hands-on experience with **SQL, R, spreadsheets, and data visualization tools**. My approach emphasizes clarity, reproducibility, and actionable insights rather than purely technical output.

## Featured Case Studies

### Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis  
*Google Data Analytics Capstone Project*

**Objective**  
Analyze how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently in order to design strategies that increase membership conversion.

**Approach**
- Cleaned and combined 12 months of trip data  
- Engineered features such as ride duration and weekday usage  
- Analyzed behavioral differences by user type and time patterns  

**Key Insight**  
Casual riders primarily use bikes for leisure on weekends, while members show consistent weekday commuting behavior.

### Bellabeat Smart Device Usage Analysis  
*Google Data Analytics Case Study*

**Objective**  
Analyze smart device usage data to identify activity, sleep, and sedentary behavior patterns that can inform Bellabeat’s marketing and product strategy.

**Approach**
- Cleaned and processed daily, hourly, and minute-level Fitbit data  
- Analyzed activity intensity, step counts, sleep duration, and heart rate  
- Identified data quality gaps such as non-wear days and syncing issues  

**Key Insight**  
Most users are sedentary or lightly active, step count strongly correlates with calories burned, and sleep duration alone does not predict activity levels.
